# Orchestra Blockly
This is the fork we made of Blockly to make it suitable for [Orchestra](http://www.karyfoundation.org/research/orchestra). It includes our special needs:
- Fully Offline: So that we can use it on Electron
- Custom Design: To suit our design harmony
- Custom Core Functions: Like for example the way block help works
